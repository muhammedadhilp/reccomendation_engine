# Recommendation System
## Overview
This repository contains a popularity-based recommendation system built using scikit-learn's TruncatedSVD for matrix factorization. The system predicts ratings for products based on user-item interactions and generates recommendations for users.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a recommendation system that suggests products to users based on their past interactions. Matrix factorization using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is employed to predict missing ratings and generate recommendations.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy
## Usage
Prepare the Data: Load your dataset and create a user-item matrix.
popularity based reccomendation: use the dataset to find the popular product using IMDB Weighted Rating Formula
collaberative reccomendation: provide personalized suggestions to users based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users
Generate Recommendations: Use the decomposed matrices to predict ratings and recommend items.

## Dataset
The dataset used should be a DataFrame containing at least three columns:

user_id: The unique identifier for users.
product_id: The unique identifier for products.
ratings: The rating given by the user to the product.

## Methodology
Data Preparation: The user-item interaction matrix is constructed from the dataset, containing information such as user ratings, purchases, or interactions with items.

### Popularity-Based Recommendation:

IMDb Weighted Mean Formula: The IMDb weighted mean formula is utilized to compute a popularity score for each item based on its average rating and the number of ratings. This popularity score is used to recommend popular items to users who haven't interacted much with the system or have diverse tastes.

### Collaborative Filtering:

Neighborhood-Based Methods: User-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques are applied to analyze similarities between users or items and make recommendations.
Matrix Factorization: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is used to decompose the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional representations to capture latent features.

Recommendation Generation: Products are recommended to users based on the predicted ratings.
## Results
The system outputs the top-N product recommendations for a given user based on the predicted ratings. These recommendations help in suggesting products that the user is likely to rate highly.
